Through that module in particular, I found myself recognising a number of bad habits and “shortcuts” I was taking. In actuality these shortcuts were meaning I was missing vital parts of the design process, and in actuality I was saving no time at all, as I would have to go back and rectify and clarify parts of the process later down the line. Following the course I have been much more cognisant of proper process and have found that I am much more efficient and clear about how to proceed when developing learning.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The concept of a “learning journey” from a macro level was also something I had never actively thought of, certainly nothing I had put to paper in any meaningful way. I have used this tool on a weekly basis since learning about it and it has really aided me in designing better learning with the learner at the centre of my focus. Learning Journey maps along with learner personas have really helped me to avoid just making learning for me (a common mistake from the reading I have done).<br><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Review of my finished project:</strong><o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I am really happy with how my project turned out. I believe it is an effective learning tool for what could be a very dry subject and meets the needs of my learner personas. The linear flow model I decided on and the implementation of that flow within the ‘adapt’ e-authoring tool works well to guide the learning scaffold the learning with familiarity and signposting. On reflection I recognise that a core and spoke model would also have been appropriate, with modules 1-3 forming a core. However I stand by my decision, as with a large learner base, I can’t ensure learners would be motivated to select spokes that they felt were “less relevant” to them, especially given that this is certification course.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">I am glad a decided on the medium of animation as I believe it is the best medium to convey complex topics with metaphors, condense learning into microlearning length chunks and maintain style and quality when adding, amending, or removing elements when needed. I will admit that I underestimated the development time of fully animated video. This is something I will be cognisant of going forward and adjust timelines appropriately.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Overall I believe I created a high quality and effective piece of learning that we can continue to grow, adapt and improve as needed.<o:p></o:p></p>",
