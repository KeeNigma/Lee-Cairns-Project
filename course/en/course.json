This would allow us to tailor it to our specific learners and processes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PSN COMPLIENCE</strong> As a Local Authority, we handle and share data within the public sector, as part of compliance with PSN, we need to demonstrate that we provide support to colleagues on how they can handle data safely, and protect themselves online.<br><strong>PROPOSAL</strong> An eLearning course is to be created in order to deliver cyber security training. It is to be accessible by all North Tyneside Council employees via the LMS (Learning pool)</p><p><strong>LEARNING GAP</strong> Analysis of the learning profiles highlights a real need for learners to see the value in what they are learning, because of this, a strong focus on how the learners can apply their learning has been focused on when considering the learning outcomes. Scenario based questioning NTC specific wording will be key to highlighting the relevance of the learning to the learners.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>NB: This is planned to be a longer series of modules (around 9), this portfolio will document the design process for the first 4 of these modules.</i><br>&nbsp;</p>",
